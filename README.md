I wish…….. I don’t know..  tonight I feel, like I wish ……… that id had a chance to meet you before you met her. She is a lovely person and I guess I can understand why her. But I wish I had a chance at you before her. We probably wouldn’t have worked but maybe it would get you out of my brain. I see you guys creating a future and I wonder…

But the killer is…you aren’t the only one I wish on. There are too many. There is the guy that was for awhile but wouldn’t or couldn’t be the one. The one I spent too much of my life dreaming about, that guy you loved as a child the one who was always an ideal but did you ever really know him? And yet all that time after you let him out of the cage deep in your mind, when you thought you had finally forgotten him. You see something and he pops back in the brain and now you cant shake that feeling. The first who made you feel seen… the one you dreamed of for longer than you should have. Now that you see all these people happy and all you can think is what if……

What if you had actually gotten that kiss.. that touch… the feeling of him. Would it have felt strange? Would it have helped you not give in to a dream? Would it have shown you the reality of the situation or would you still be here all these years later thinking about that same person? The one you don’t actually know anymore, now and even then it was always just an idea. A wish amongst a life that didn’t feel right.... 

How did we get back here?
